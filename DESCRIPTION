Title: Knowledge-Driven Online Multimodal Automated Phenotyping System (KOMAP) 
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Xin Xiong
Maintainer: Xin Xiong <xinxiong@hsph.harvard.edu>
Description: Fit an unsupervised phenotyping system which does not require manual chart review to acquire gold standard labels for algorithm training and validation. The online algorithm only requires summary-level covariance matrix for coefficient training. To get a quick model evaluation without individual-level data, users can upload conditional mean vector and covariance matrix to obtain a simulated AUC. Can deal with cases when both codified and NLP features are available, or when only one feature type is at hand.
